Astro is created by designers, developers, product managers, data analysts, data scientists, stakeholders and enthusiasts, which helps us protect the brand concepts, elevate consistency of user experience and increase the speed and efficiency of how we design and build products for our customers.

### Open

Magnetis believes that good design and experiences can **impact the product market and society itself**. Our **design and code assets are open** so we can contribute to the community and help new product teams.

### Accessible

Design is meant to be **for all**. Astro style and components follow basic recommendations from the **WCAG guidelines** for accessibility, with tested contrast ratios and good practices in legibility and screen reading solutions.
